## a little about why i'm excited for electronic textiles

i am a sophomore at williams college with a prospective double major in comparative literature & theatre. my favorite thing to do in life is make things! learning to write & edit simple code is something i've wanted to do for years--the creativity & autonomy one has as a coder is so exciting to me--but i have never gotten the chance. i am thrilled at the opportunity to take electronic textiles so that i might be able to let my creative mind run wild while also learning a bit of code.
even the process of getting to build and customize my own course website has been a really exciting and gratifying process for me. i feel so much freedom, and it's amazing to be able to edit code and see the changes appear before my own eyes. i can't wait to continue learning more about coding and to make a final project that i will cherish!

thanks so much for checking out my page and stay tuned for updates!
