## a little about why i'm excited for electronic textiles

i am a sophomore at williams college with a prospective double major in comparative literature & theatre. my favorite thing to do in life is make things! i have always wanted to try my hand at coding---the creativity & autonomy you have as a coder is so exciting to me---but have never gotten the chance. i am thrilled at the opportunity to take electronic textiles so that i might be able to let my creative mind run wild while also learning a bit of code.
so far we have essentially been building our own course websites, which is a really exciting and gratifying process. i feel so much freedom! it's amazing to be able to edit code and see the changes appear before my own eyes. learning to write & edit simple code is something i've wanted to do for years, but have never been able to do.

thanks so much for checking out my page and stay tuned for updates!
