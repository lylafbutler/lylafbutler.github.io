**i did it!**

hey there! 

thanks for coming along on this journey with me. here is the final product of my "upside-down-o-meter", a doll i made modeled to look like eleven from stranger things.
based on the tv show, this doll will inform the user when the upside down is lurking by lighting up her red LED eyes when it is dark, and playing the stranger things theme song when it is both dark and cold.
my motivation for this project was that i love the stranger things tv show, and was really feeling in the spirit because of the release of the new season. this helpful doll will keep the upside down at bay by letting the user know when evil might be lurking.
the materials i used for this project included 1 lilypad arduino, 1 etextiles lipo, 1 lilypad light sensor, 1 lilypad temperature sensor, 1 lilypad buzzer, 2 red external LEDs, conductive thread, stuffing, assorted colors of embroidery floss and felt, and finally, scissors and a sewing needle.

here is the revised version of the paper prototype i made for my final project:

and here is a photo of my working alligator prototype:

and here are the different states of my working doll!

here she is when it is warm and light out:

a few tips to my past self would be firstly to make sure my paper prototype is really truly solid. my original paper prototype was definitely not as detailed as it should have been, and if not for iris's recommendation of re-doing it, it would definitely have caused me a lot of grief!
secondly, despite my new and improved paper prototype, i still had trouble flipping the doll inside out when i was done sewing due to some tiny passages i had created. my ti[ to my past self would be to make sure there is enough "flipping space" before i sew the doll and have to reopen a bunch of passages of sewing!
third, things would have been a lot easier for my past self if i had attempted to test my song code out on its own before adding it to the rest of the code. it was my first time writing out the notes in code on my own for a song, and things would have been much easier if i had gotten that code really solid before i started adding it into other things.

thank you again for coming along with me on this magical etextiles journey! it has been full of challenges, discoveries, and loads of fun. but this is just the beginning...
thank you!
