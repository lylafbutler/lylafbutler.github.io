**hello!**
i hope this blog post finds you well. i am very excited to share my sewing sampler assignment with you! i included some flowers and stars (flowers with attempted french knots in the centers), and a little fern stitching in addition to the suggested stitches for the assignment.
one tip i have for my past self is to use an embroidery hoop earlier! i was using one by the end of the project and it instantly made my life so much easier. additionally, i'd tell my past self not to freak out when something doesn't go right. i could have saved myself a lot of anxiety if i had just slowed down and really tried to figure out what the problem was in times when things weren't exactly going my way.
in a kind of lovely way, you can also apply this philosophy to coding! i'll try and keep this advice in mind as in venture into the world of programming more and more in this class.
