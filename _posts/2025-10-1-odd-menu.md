**happy october!**

i'm so glad you're back! for this assignment, we created programs that, when given an odd number for a variable called "numberChoice", would lead you to meal choices on a "secret menu."
depending on what number you inputted in for the "mealChoice" variable, the program would provide you with one of three meal options.

a tip i would give my past self for this assignment is to make sure the order for nested "else if" etc. statements is functional. i had a lot of stress trying to figure out why i wasn't getting the output i wanted before realizing that it was all about the order of the statements!

here's a photo of one of my outputs. enjoy!
