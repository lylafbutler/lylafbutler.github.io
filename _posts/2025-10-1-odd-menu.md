**happy october!**
i'm so glad you're back! for this assignment, we created programs that, when given an odd number for a variable called "numberChoice", would lead you to meal choices on a "secret menu."
depending on what number you inputted in for the "mealChoice" variable, the program would provide you with one of three meal options.

here's a photo of one of my outputs!
