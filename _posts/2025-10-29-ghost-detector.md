**it's spooky season...**

in this assignment, we used the light and temperature sensors that connected to the Lilypad Arduino to create a "ghost detector" which turned red LEDs on when it was dark and cold enough. This was also our first assignment that incorporated "analogRead", so that was a really exciting thing to explore.

the tip i'd have for my past self when completing this assignment is to make sure i always carefully go through my code to make sure there are no spelling errors before frustrating myself, trying to figure out what i did wrong. that would have saved me a lot of grief with this one--a small spelling error ended up making all the difference!

here's a photo of my ghost detector. happy halloween!
