**hi there!**

for this assignment, we each wrote programs that simulated the flashing patterns of three separate types of firelies using the lilypad arduino.
it was really exciting to work out our first arduino assignment using the lilypad, but also extremely challenging.

a tip i'd have for myself attempting this assignment is to slow down. i quickly got caught up in the thick of my code, wondering why things didn't work. but if i had just slowed down and planned things out in a more linear way, i think the whole process would have gone much smoother.

i am feeling increasingly more and more like a programmer, especially after this assignment!
here's a photo of my program's output for reference.
