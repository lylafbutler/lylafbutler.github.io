**i'm so excited to share my homemade switches assignment with you!**

here is my homemade switches project. i am really proud of this one! for my project, i used my knowledge of circuitry to build a circuit with three LEDs and two homemade switches; one of them was made using a paperclip and a conductive thread patch, and the other was a button that used two pieces of conductive fabric separated by a layer of permeable fabric. when both homemade switches were used, the lights turned on! i designed my sampler to look like a starry night sky, and when you press on the moon (which is one of the buttons) as long as the paperclip switch is active, the stars begin to shine with yellow LEDs!

one tip i'd give others attempting this project for the first time is to be really strategic about the fabric's permeability if you're making a button the way i did it. it's hard to ensure the button can only be activated part of the time, because cutting holes in the fabric separating the conductive fabric patches is not an exact science!

here is the alligator prototype stage of the project. i used a button and a switch in place of my two homemade switch concepts.
