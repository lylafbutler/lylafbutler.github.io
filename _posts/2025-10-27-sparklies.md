**hey...happy monday!**

for this assignment, we combined the separate state-based programs we had written to simulate the flashing of different kinds of fireflies. this resulted in a program that created all three flashing patterns at the same time!

a tip i'd have for myself attempting this assignment is to make sure all of my state-based approaches separately work really well separately before i put them together. i was really proud of myself for being able to make things work after putting some good time in on my separate sparklies.

here are some photos the sparklies, sparkling on their merry way together! so cool.
