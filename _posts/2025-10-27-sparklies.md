**happy wednesday!**

for this assignment, we each wrote programs that simulated three LEDs turning on and which colors they would be. the color, number of leds that turned on, and the frequency of the LEDs turning on were all defined by separate variables.

a tip i'd have for myself attempting this assignment is to slow down. i quickly got caught up in the thick of my code, wondering why things didn't work. but if i had just slowed down and planned things out in a more linear way, i think the whole process would have gone much smoother.

i am feeling increasingly more and more like a programmer, especially after this assignment!
here's a photo of my program's output for reference.
