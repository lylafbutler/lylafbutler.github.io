**let's get musical!**

for this assignment, we used the arduino buzzer element to write code that would play a song when a switch was turned on.
i had a ton of fun with this assignment--as a very musical person, it was really rewarding to be able to make a song from the programming i wrote.
the song i chose was "cantina band" from star wars because i thought it would be pretty groovy and fun--and i was right!
the main tip i'd have for my past self when completing this assignment is to make sure i put the song part of the code under "loop" and not under "setup." this little switch caused me a lot of confusion, but once i fixed it, i was able to play my song more than once!

here's a photo of my arduino kit output!
