**this is my "sweater weather" assignment post!**
i really liked this assigment because it made me feel like a real programmer.
as a kid, i was a _huge_ fan of choose-your-own-adventure books, and this felt a little bit like creating one of those.
i'd love for you to try out my program, but unfortunately, it's only for professor howley's eyes. sorry to disappoint!
what i will do, though, is tell you a little but about what it does.
the program, using c, practices conditional statements. it will output a statement telling you what kind of clothing is appropriate to wear based on a temperature input.
a tip i'd tell my future self is to be careful with else statements. because else statements are catch-all, my program outputted the else statement i had written much more frequently than i had expected it to! it took a little experimenting to figure out when the program would and wouldn't print my else statement.
because you can't try it out on your own, here---a little screenshot to keep you satiated. i hope you enjoy!
