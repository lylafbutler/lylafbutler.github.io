**this is my "sweater weather" assignment post!**
i really liked this assigment because it made me feel like a real programmer.
as a kid, i was a _huge_ fan of choose your own adventure books, and this felt a little bit like creating one of those.
i'd love for you to try out my program, but unfortunately, it's only for professor howley's eyes. sorry to disappoint!
but here---a little screenshot to keep you satiated. i hope you enjoy!
