**hi there!**
i hope this blog post finds you well. here is my plushy redux assignment! 
the program determines whether or not the LEDs in a plushy will turn on based on inputs for variables that represent "button" and "switch."

one tip i have for my past self is to start working on coding earlier! it always takes longer than i think it will.

here's a screenshot of my code!
