**this is my circuit plushy assignment!**
here is the final product from our circuit plushy assignment. this process was miles more challenging than i thought it might be at first glance. however, despite the difficulty level of working wth circuitry and conductive thread, i ended up with a product that really works that i'm truly proud of. to me, he kind of looks like a weird little christmas tree creature.

one tip i would tell others attempting this project for the first time would be to make sure they keep threads short when knotting them, and also have a lot of patience with themselves. many times i doubted my competence, but here i am, on the other side of the project with an end result i love!

here are some photos of my circuit plushy for you to enjoy.
this is my paper protoype for the plushy, helping me to plan out what i created!

this is my prototype using alligator clips to test that my design worked.

here's the front of the finished plushy product. you can see that i'm pressing the button with the switch set to "on", so the leds turn on.
