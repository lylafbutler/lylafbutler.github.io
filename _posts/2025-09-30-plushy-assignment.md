**hey there!**
my name is lyla. i'm so glad you made it here to my little corner of the internet.

i'm a sophomore (class of 2028) at williams college. i've had quite a bit of sewing experience--i used to take costume production classes in middle school and a bit in high school. i love to sew and create my own clothes and projects. i have zero programming experience and can't wait to explore the world of coding. in this class, i hope to gain some coding experience and create a project that i'm really proud of. one fun fact about me is that my favorite ice cream flavor is ben & jerry's "the tonight dough."



here's a photo of me to remind you of what i look like. if we haven't met yet, now you'll be able to find me when we get coffee! (are you free tomorrow?)
