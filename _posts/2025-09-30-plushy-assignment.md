**this is my circuit plushy assignment!**
here is the final product from our circuit plushy assignment. this process was miles more challenging than i thought it might be at first glance. however, despite the difficulty level of working wth circuitry and conductive thread, i ended up with a product that really works that i'm truly proud of. to me, he kind of looks like a weird little christmas tree creature.

one tip i would tell myself for the future of ths project would be to make sure i keep threads short when knotting them, and also having a lot of patience with myself. many times i doubted my competence, but here i am, on the other side of the project with an end result i love!

here are some photos of my circuit plushy for you to enjoy.
