**buongiorno, principessa!**

for this assignment, we had our first foray into using inputs and random numbers! the programs we wrote generated random LED colors on our Lilypad when a button was pressed.
a tip i'd give to someone attempting this assignment for the first time is to make sure i included something that would block the LEDs from continuing to generate random colors when continually pressed. this was a loophole that i hadn't previously taken into account, and was something i definitely spent a lot of time on fixing.

here's a photo of the pressed button generating a random LED color!
