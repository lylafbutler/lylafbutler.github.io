**oh hey there! welcome back.**

for this assignment, we learned what arrays were and implemented them in a program that turns on a random LED every second.
programming arrays was really tricky for me---it took me a while to even understand what was happening in the code.
i think my biggest tip for my past self on this assignment would be to make sure i fully understand the content and complete the worksheet thoroughly before beginning my code. jumping into code before i feel like i truly understand what's going on is very confusing!

here's a photo of my output. thanks for reading!
