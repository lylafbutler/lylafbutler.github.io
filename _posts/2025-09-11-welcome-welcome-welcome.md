**hey there!**
my name is lyla. i'm so glad you made it here to my little corner of the internet. i'm so excited about taking electronic textiles--so far we have essentially been building our own course websites, which is a really exciting and gratifying process. i feel so much freedom! it's amazing to be able to edit code and see the changes appear before my own eyes. learning to write & edit simple code is something i've wanted to do for years, but have never been able to do. thanks so much for checking out my page and stay tuned for updates!

## Here is a secondary heading

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:
